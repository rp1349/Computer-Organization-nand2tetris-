Based on the book “The Elements of Computing Systems: second edition” by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.

Project 0 is just some solutions to the Boolean Simplification problems for familiarity with the concepts of the course and helps understand the projects better. 

Description of Project 1-6 is available at https://www.nand2tetris.org/course.

Project 7-8 is a part of Computer Organization class at Mississippi State University by Dr. Edward Luke. The documentation is a part of his intellectual property (IP). The solutions to the project are work of my own.
